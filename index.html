        <h2>About David</h2>
        <p>David Martin Nagle (born: July 6, 1992 [age 32]), better known online as Nogla (formerly Daithi De Nogla), is an Irish YouTuber known for his deep voice, random outbursts of gibberish, dimwitted moments, and weird noises, as well as his sometimes annoying personality. He is considered the punching bag of the crew mostly due to him always being the target of his friends' pranks, jokes, and abuse in most games. Until December 2021, he was mainly known as Daithi De Nogla.</p>

            <li>His original Garry's Mod model was Zoidberg. His friends made fun of his wide eyes and appendages hanging from his face.
